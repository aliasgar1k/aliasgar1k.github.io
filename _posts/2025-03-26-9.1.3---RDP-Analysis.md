To detect RDP brute force attempts, we need to analyze the log data in Splunk. After researching a bit about the Windows event logs, we found that logon failures are recorded with Event ID 4625, which is generated when a logon attempt fails.

We can use the following filter to identify these events:

```
index=windows_logs EventCode=4625
```

- results we have 268 events.

Additionally, we can filter the events by `Logon_Type` to only show logon attempts that are using network logon, which includes RDP connections. This would filter out local logons and helps to reduce noise in the data and focus on logon attempts that are more likely to be related to RDP brute force attacks. Note `Logon_Type` 3 corresponds to network logon, which includes any logon attempt made over a network connection including SMB, RCMP, etc and not just RDP. thus We can do this by adding the following filter: `Logon_Type=3`. So, the complete filter would be: 

```
index=windows_logs (EventCode=4625 AND Logon_Type=3)
```

- result we have now only 260 events.

Once we have identified the relevant log events further we need to analyze the log data. we will look into specific logs to see what fields and values its shows on a failed login attempt. here we are looking for fields that highlight certain key information which helps us in detecting from where and who is attacking on what and for how long. So, looking in to the specific log we have identified `Source_Network_Address`, `Workstation_Name`, and `Account_Name` to  get the source of the logon attempts, the workstation being used, and the account being targeted, respectively. These fields are relevant because they help us to identify the IP address of the attacker, the workstation that is being used to make the logon attempts, and the account that is being targeted.

next We can use the `stats` command to count the number of logon attempts by these fields, which can help us to identify potential brute force attempts. For example, we can use the following query: 

```
index=windows_logs (EventCode=4625 AND Logon_Type=3) | stats count as attempts by Source_Network_Address, Workstation_Name, Account_Name
```

![](2025-03-26-9.1.3---RDP-Analysis-5.png)

- This will show us the number of logon attempts by each source IP address, workstation, and account.

Now that we have the count of logon attempts by source IP address, workstation, and account, we can use this information to identify potential brute force attempts. To do this, we can add a threshold to our query to only show us the results where the count of attempts is greater than a certain number. For example, we can use the following query: 

```
index=windows_logs (EventCode=4625 AND Logon_Type=3) | stats count as attempts by Source_Network_Address, Workstation_Name, Account_Name | where attempts > 5 
```

![](2025-03-26-9.1.3---RDP-Analysis-6.png)

- This will show us only the source IP addresses, workstations, and accounts that have more than 5 logon attempts, which could indicate a potential brute force attempt.

In conclusion, detecting RDP brute force attempts using Splunk is a straightforward and effective process. By using such queries we can detect potential attacks and take action to protect our systems. Note that there are multiple methods and approaches to detecting RDP brute force attacks, and this query is just one example. By leveraging Splunk and Windows event logs, we can develop effective detection and response strategies to stay ahead of potential security risks.


```
index=* sourcetype=win*security Account_Name=* Account_Name!="" | stats count(eval(Keywords="Audit Success")) as successes count(eval(Keywords="Audit Failure")) as failures by Account_Name, Workstation_Name | where successes>0 AND failures>5
