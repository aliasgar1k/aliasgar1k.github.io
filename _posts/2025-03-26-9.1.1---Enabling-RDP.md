## 4. Select Users for Access (Optional)
  
Further down the Remote Desktop settings panel, you can click on "Select users that can remotely access this PC" to choose specific users who are allowed access. Note that accounts with [Administrator privileges](https://www.howtogeek.com/739981/how-to-change-a-user-account-to-administrator-on-windows-10/) can automatically access the PC. If this is your personal computer, you are likely using an Administrator account.
