## C2 Overview

**Introduction to Command and Control**  
  
When a malicious executable is downloaded and run, it performs a series of actions to gather information and establish persistence. One common action is to establish a Command and Control (C2) session, which allows an attacker to communicate with a compromised system and execute various actions to achieve their objectives.  
  
**What is Command and Control?**  
  
According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Command and Control consists of techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a victim's network. In other words, C2 is where an attacker has control over a victim's computer, allowing them to perform various actions to achieve their goals.  
  
**Why is Establishing a C2 Important?**  
  
Establishing a C2 is crucial for an attacker to perform additional actions and move closer to their objectives. This can include stealing credentials, moving laterally, stealing sensitive information, or executing ransomware. To do damage in an environment, an attacker must have access to it, and one common way to achieve this access is through a C2 channel.  
  
**Common Tools and Frameworks**  
  
There are many tools and frameworks used in the wild for C2. Some common ones include:  
  
- **Metasploit**: A popular framework owned by Rapid7, which comes with many different types of exploits and auxiliaries to probe target machines and determine if they're vulnerable to a particular exploit.  
  
- **Cobalt Strike**: A commercial product built for adversary emulation, commonly seen in compromised environments. Fortunately, the industry has developed detections to help analysts detect Cobalt Strike.  
  
- **Sliver**: An open-source adversary emulation framework created by Bishop Fox, which supports many different ways to establish a C2 connection, such as mTLS, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, or WireGuard.  
  
- **Mythic**:  Mythic is a C2 framework built with Go, Docker, and a web browser user interface, which is the one that we'll be using in the project. By using Mythic, operators will have the ability to track their payloads and C2 profiles, which is quite nice as you'll be able to answer the question of what payload triggered this callback or why is there a call back. Mythic uses C2 profiles for agents, so it knows how to communicate back to the Mythic server. As of now, there are a total of 21 different agents that are available, which makes it a versatile and powerful tool for C2 operations.

**Conclusion**  
  
In conclusion, Command and Control is a critical component of an attacker's toolkit, allowing them to communicate with compromised systems and execute various actions to achieve their objectives. Understanding C2 and the common tools and frameworks used in the wild is essential for aspiring SOC analysts and security professionals. By familiarizing themselves with these concepts, they can better detect and respond to C2-related threats and stay one step ahead of attackers. With the use of Mythic in our project, we'll be able to dive deeper into the world of C2 and explore its capabilities and features in more detail.

## Pre-requisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system: 
- `docker`  
- `make`  
  
### Install Docker

There are various ways to install Docker, including using package managers like `apt` or `yum`, downloading binaries directly, and utilizing the convenience script provided by Docker. Each method has its advantages, such as ease of use or customization options. 

However, Here we will choose the convenience script because it simplifies the installation process, enabling non-interactive setups tailored to specific development environments. This method is especially helpful for quickly provisioning Docker on multiple machines or for automating deployment processes, making it a practical choice for developers looking to streamline their workflow.

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-convenience-script

**Installing Docker Using the Convenience Script**
  
Docker provides a convenience script to install Docker into development environments non-interactively at [https://get.docker.com/](https://get.docker.com/). While this script is not recommended for production environments, it is useful for creating a provisioning script tailored to your needs.  
  
**Download the Convenience Script**
  
To download the convenience script to your system, run the following command:  
  
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
```
  
If you encounter the error "Command 'curl' not found," this means `curl` is not installed on your system. Install `curl` using the following command and then run the previous command again:  
  
```
sudo apt install curl
```
  
**Preview Script Steps**

Run the script with the `--dry-run` option to learn what steps the script will execute when invoked:  

```
sudo sh ./get-docker.sh --dry-run
```

**Install Docker**

Now, run the script to install the latest stable release of Docker on Linux:  
  
```
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-2.png)
  
You have now successfully installed and started Docker Engine. Also You can verify the installation using the Docker command:  
  
```
# Show Docker images on your system
sudo docker images
```

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-3.png)
  
As there are currently no images, it will display an empty table.

### Install Make

- check `make` version to confirm if its installed or not. 

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-4.png)

- If you get the following error like above, that means `make` is not installed on your system and we need to install it.
- To install `make` run the following command:

```
sudo apt install make
```

### Step 7: Explore the Mythic Dashboard
  
- **Callbacks**: View active or past callbacks from agents.  
- **Payloads (Hazard Icon)**: Generate or manage payloads and wrappers.  
- **Search**: Inspect tasks, files, credentials, and artifacts.  
- **Files**: Host files or view uploads/downloads from target machines.  
- **Artifacts**: Access fingerprints, screenshots, credentials, and callbacks.  
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with MITRE ATT&CK mapping.  
- **Tags**: Organize target machines with custom tags.  
- **Operations**: Rename your operation (e.g., "Operation My").  
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle by clicking the **sun icon**.  

## Installing an Agent

Once we are done with mythic c2 server installation, next we will need to install a C2 Agent.
To start, we need to head over to our Mythic web interface. Upon accessing the interface, we notice that under our payload section, we don't have any agents listed yet. This is because we haven't downloaded any agents yet. We can install an agent using Mythic CLI but first we need to choose what kind of agent we wish to install. 

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-10.png)

To see what kind of agents are available, you can head over to the [GitHub page for Mythic agents](https://github.com/MythicAgents). and open [Agent Capabilities Matrix](https://mythicmeta.github.io/overview/agent_matrix.html). Here, you will have access to a list of available agents. Review the list and choose the agent you want to install. Based on the capabilities, Apollo seems to be a suitable choice for this example.

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-11.png)

Now go back to the GitHub page for Mythic agents and open the [Apollo](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo) repository where you will find the command to install apollo agent.

So To install the Apollo agent, we use the following command:  
  
```
./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo.git
```

This command downloads and installs the Apollo agent. Once the installation is complete, we can verify that the agent has been successfully installed by checking the Mythic web interface.

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-12.png)

## Installing a Profile  
  
After agent is installed successfully, we need to install a certain profile for it to communicate on. For example: HTTP, SMB, TCP, etc. Thus the next thing to do is to install a C2 profile. To find all the C2 profiles, we can search up "Mythic C2 profiles" and open its GitHub page. Here, you would have a list of profiles. The one we're going to use today for this challenge is [HTTP](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/http).

To install this profile, we will use the following command:  

```
./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/http
```
  
This command downloads and installs the HTTP profile. Once the installation is complete, we can verify that the profile has been successfully installed by checking the Mythic web interface.

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-13.png)

## Generate a New Payload
  
Now that we have an Agent and a Profile, we can generate a new payload. For this we head over to the biohazard icon and click on "Actions" on the top right. Then, we click on "Generate New Payload". 

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-14.png)

**Select Target Operating System:**
The target machine is going to be Windows, so select "Windows" and click on "Next".  

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-15.png)

**Select Target Payload Type:**
On this window If we have multiple agents installed, they'll be listed under a drop down menu on the very top before we can decide on certain build parameters, but we only have Apollo,.  

Under Build Parameter we can select payload output type, We want to output this as a Windows executable so we will select `WinExe` and click on "Next"

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-16.png)

**Build Commands Into Agent:**
Here are the available commands. We can choose to include all the commands by clicking `>>` button or select specific ones by selecting that command in the list and clicking on `>` button. For this example, we will include all the available commands and click on "Next".

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-17.png)

**Select C2 Profile:**  
for the C2 profiles we will be given with the list of installed C2 profiles. Toggle on the C2 profile you want to use. For this example we will include "http" profile. 

Once you Toggle on a profile you will be required to fill in some important information. Here we are fine with defaults, but we do need to change the callback host, we change from `https` to `http` and put in the IP address of our Mythic server. 

At this setting it will callback at every 10 second on port 80 and use the given specified User Agent in the http request which is fine for us, so we click "Next".

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-18.png)

**Payload Review**    
For the payload name, we're going to name this as `svchost.exe`, and for the description, we'll just say "payload/agent". Then, we'll click on "Create Payload".  

![](2025-03-26-9.2.1---C2-Installation-19.png)
  
**Downloading the Payload**  
Once the payload has been created, we'll see "Agent ready for download", and we can click on "Download here" to download the payload file.
