Today I’m very excited to guide you through my latest project, which focuses on going through our Security Information and Event Management implementation using Splunk. If you’re eager to build your skills in cybersecurity and learn how to implement a SIEM system, you’re in the right place.

Perhaps you're starting your journey toward becoming a SOC analyst but feel a bit lost regarding where to begin with practical implementation. Don’t worry! In the next few videos, I’ll walk you through the process step-by-step to help you gain valuable experience - all for free! The goal is to equip you with the knowledge necessary to monitor and analyze security logs effectively.

I’ve studied extensively in security operations, which has inspired me to create this project. The aim is to fill the gap where many entry-level SOCK professionals miss out on practical implementation skills.

By the end of this series, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively set up and manage a Splunk SIEM in your home lab. This project will not only enhance your skill set but also prepare you for real-world security challenges. The skills you’ll learn will be invaluable in enhancing your career as you’ll walk away with practical abilities that you can showcase on your resume and confidently discuss in interviews.

Now, let’s break down how we’re going to go through our Splunk SIEM implementation. First, we will begin with the components involved in this project:

- **SOC Analyst Workstation:** A dedicated Windows machine where we’ll install Splunk Enterprise for monitoring logs.

- **Client Machines:** One Windows machine and one Linux machine that will send their logs to our Splunk instance.

- **Kali Linux Attacker Machine:** This machine will simulate various attacks, like SSH and RDP brute force, against the client machines to test their defenses.

- **Mythic C2 Server:** This server will execute command-and-control (C2) attacks on the Windows client, helping us track malicious activities.

Throughout this project, you will learn a structured approach to deploying a Splunk SIEM system in your home lab. Here’s a snapshot of what you will accomplish:

1. Define your use cases for monitoring specific security needs.
2. Plan the deployment architecture for your SOC analyst's workstation.
3. Download and install Splunk on the dedicated Windows machine.
4. Configure data inputs from both your client machines.
5. Install and configure Universal Forwarders on those client machines to forward logs to Splunk.
6. Set up necessary indexes—think `windows_logs` and `linux_logs`—to keep your data organized.
7. Enable and configure data receiving settings in Splunk.
8. Implement security monitoring on the client machines to capture critical events.
9. Set up alerts for detected attacks and create dashboards for visualizing security data.
10. Validate that your setup is functional and threats can be detected effectively.
11. Configure user roles and permissions so your SOC analysts can operate seamlessly within Splunk.
12. Provide training to users on using Splunk effectively.
13. Continuously monitor the performance of your Splunk instance.
14. Fine-tune configurations to optimize indexing and searching processes.
15. Document every aspect of your setup for future reference.
16. Review and iterate on your security measures regularly.
17. Stay current with emerging threats and improve your security posture accordingly.

I'm thrilled for us to embark on this practical journey together! If you're aspiring to be a SOC analyst, engaging in this project will provide you with essential skills and insights. I highly encourage you to work alongside me in your own setup, boosting your chances for real-world applicability of what you’ve learned.

 I’m excited to share more insights in the upcoming posts, and together, we’ll build a strong foundation in cybersecurity. Let’s get ready to explore this journey together! See you soon!
