## Objective

The project objective is to demonstrate the installation of Nessus, a leading vulnerability scanner, on Kali Linux. The process includes signing up for a license, downloading the software, and executing installation commands. A vulnerability scan is then performed on a Kioptrix system to identify and analyze vulnerabilities. This showcases the importance of using Nessus for vulnerability assessment and remediation in real-world scenarios, contributing to understanding IT security fundamentals.

## Tools Used

* **Nessus Vulnerability Scanner**: Utilized for conducting vulnerability scans and analyzing scan results.
* **Kioptrix**: Used as a target system for vulnerability scanning and analysis.
* **Kali Linux**: Operating system environment for running the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner and conducting scans.

## What is Nessus Vulnerability Scanner?

Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, developed by Tenable, is a powerful tool used to identify weaknesses in computer systems and networks. It acts like a digital security inspector. Nessus works in phases: first, it scans ports on a device to see which services are running. Then, it uses a vast library of pre-built checks, called plugins, to probe these services for known vulnerabilities. These plugins can identify outdated software, misconfigurations, and weaknesses specific to different operating systems and applications. By analyzing the results, Nessus provides a vulnerability report, allowing IT professionals to prioritize and address potential security risks.

## Step 1: Kioptrix Setup

### Download and Installation

Download Kioptrix Level 1 from the provided download link: [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/)

Run Kioptrix Level 1 on Virtualization Platform of your choice. once booted it will show the following login prompt.

### Identify Kioptrix's Assigned IP Address

In Kali Linux open the Terminal and use "netdiscover" tool to check for online machine on our network, one of which will be kioptrix machine.

```
root@kali:~# netdiscover -r 192.168.54.0/24  
  
Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

        OR

* [https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true)

### Install Nessus

* now go to Downloads and install nessus using following command:

```
sudo dpkg -i <file_name>
```

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-2.png)

### Configure Nessus

* Now lets start nessus and visit [https://localhost:8834/](https://localhost:8834/) , accept the certificate when asked for.

```
/etc/init.d/nessusd start
```

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-3.png)

* This will initialize the nessus installer and ask for what nessus version you want to install.
* Here choose "Nessus Essentials" and continue.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-4.png)

* Fill in the details to get a Activation code in your Email. (tempmail.org)

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-5.png)

* Once we recieve get the email, give in activation code.
* Next create a username and password. (do not forget, will next time to login)

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-6.png)

* Once installed completely, we will a screen something like this:

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-7.png)

## Step 3: Perform a Basic Network Scan

### Create a New Scan

* From top right corner click on `New Scan`.
* Select `Basic Network Scan`.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-8.png)

### Configure Scan Settings

* Basic Network scan option will take you to the following page. Here provide Name, Description and Targets.
* we add suitable Name of the scan and description. (e.g., "Kioptrix Basic Network Scan").
* Target is very important. You can add range of IPs or whole network to check the connected Machine.
* here we are attempting to scan kioptrix Machine for vulerabilities, Thus enter the IP address of the Kioptrix VM.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-9.png)

**NOTE: in this Free version we can scan any private IP address and at a time total 16 of those at once.**

* Here in the same tab down we have "Discovery" where we can set number of ports to scan.
* Here you can choose what ports you want to scan. It can be from a particale port scan or a Full port scan. Here we can also perform a UDP scan as well, but do note this take like forever to complete. Hence choose wisely.
* For us we will be conducting a Full port scan on TCP.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-10.png)

* Next in "Assessment" we can choose scan type. There are 3 preconfigured scan type: Known Web, All Web Quick and All Web Complex. depending on the needs of assessment we can select the option we want.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-11.png)

* Report is to customize the results reporting as per our needs. If configured correctly we simply copy/paste some of the findings in the main report at the end of an assessment.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-12.png)

* Once done with configuring all options, "Save" it.
* Now on the nessus home page under "My Scans" we will have a new scan ready.
* From right corner click on the arrow button to Launch the scans and wait until it completes to achieve results.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-13.png)

**NOTE: Before starting the scans we are typically required to inform client that we are starting the scans on them as this is bit noisy on the network.**

## Step 3: Analyzing Results

* we can click on the running scan to see ongoing findings.
* Here we can see the scan progress and status all along.
* we can check 3 tab on the top: "Host" for the targets that are being scanned, "Vulnerabilities" for found vulnerabilities and "History" to save history if multiple scans are run.
* we see found vulnerabilities are grouped into Critical, High, Medium, Low and Info. Where Critical are highly dangerous and info is mostly information disclosure.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-14.png)

* Moving to Vulnerabilities tab, We can click on the each vulnerability to see that vulnerabiltiy in details.
* It provide all the information about the CVSS score, Plugin Rules Applied, Scan Durations, scan summary, risk severity.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-15.png)

* Once the Scans are completed we will have a new tab in the upper tabs lists called "Remediations".
* Moving to this tab we will see the list of solutions for the respective found vulnerabilities.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-16.png)

* we can export nessus report from top right corner which can be adjoint with the main Pentest report.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-17.png)

## Step 4: Perform a Basic Network Credential Scan

* From the main dashboard create a new scan by click on the top right corner.
* same as before choose for "Basic Network Scan".

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-18.png)

* Fill in the settings exactly as same as "Basic Network Scans" (From above).

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-19.png)

* Now in the upper Tabs we see a Tab for Credentials. Move to the following tab and we will see a list of services, from here you can choose a service for which you have a valid set of credential.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-20.png)

* For instance here we choose "Windows".
* In here we need to select what type of Authentication method we want nessus to got through and next give in the Username, Password and Domain name.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-21.png)

* we also have here various other options below, we can check and uncheck these options as per the working policies of our target.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-22.png)

* For SSH on linux machines we can also have option to choose the method for previlege escalation such as su, sudo, etc. Once can choose an appropriate method which we allow the nessus to upgrade as root on linux and perform scans from admin level.
* Here we can also change port for SSH service according to target if needed.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-23.png)

* Once done with feeling all the requirements we can "Save" it and launch the scan from Dashboard just as we did in Basic Normal Scan using the play button.

![](2025-05-26-vulnerability-scanning-with-nessus-24.png)

* And as scans are completed, we can analyze the results just as we did before, but remember the findings in this scan is much more detailed and accurate as the nessus was able to login to on target and perform further checks.
