**When to Check for C2 Activity**  
  
In the world of cybersecurity, detecting Command and Control (C2) activity is a critical task for organizations looking to protect themselves from malicious actors. But when should an organization check for C2 activity? The answer lies in various scenarios, including:  
  
1. **Security Incidents**: When a security incident occurs, such as a malware outbreak or unauthorized access, an organization may investigate to determine if C2 activity is involved.  
  
2. **Threat Intelligence**: When an organization receives threat intelligence reports that indicate potential C2 activity, they may investigate to determine if the threat is present in their network.  
3. **Regular Security Audits**: As part of regular security audits, organizations may check for C2 activity to ensure their network is secure.  
  
4. **Suspicious Activity**: If an organization detects suspicious activity, such as unusual network traffic or system behavior, they may investigate to determine if C2 activity is involved.  
  
**Gaining Knowledge about the C2**  
  
In some of these scenarios, an organization may have prior knowledge about the specific C2 they are looking for. For example, when they receive **Threat Intelligence**, they may gain knowledge about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor, as well as indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the C2. This intelligence can inform their search for C2 activity and help them identify potential threats.

As we already know that we've installed the Mythic C2 framework, specifically the Apollo agent, on one of our windows client machine. We can use this threat intelligence to inform our detection efforts. We're going to suppose that our threat intelligence indicates that Mythic C2 can utilise several Windows-based agents to establise a command and control session over target such as Apollo, Athena, Freyja, Merlin, Thanatos, Atlas, Arachne, Hannibal, Xenon, and Service Wrapper. With this knowledge, we can refine our search to detect potential C2 activity in our network.

To do this, we'll begin by searching for the known Windows-based C2 agent names, such as Apollo, Athena, and others, in our process creation logs. 

**Searching for agent name in OrginalFileName:**

```
index="windows_logs" sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" OriginalFileName IN ("*apollo*", "*athena*", "*freyja*", "*merlin*", "*thanatos*", "*atlas*", "*arachne*", "*hannibal*", "*xenon*", "*service_wrapper*")
```

To make sense of the data, we'll extract specific fields that will help us correlate the information and gain a deeper understanding of the potential C2 activity using a table. These fields will include _time, User, OriginalFileName, Image, ParentCommandLine, CommandLine and ProcessId. By analyzing the table, we'll be able to build a more complete picture of the C2 activity and identify potential indicators of compromise.

**Table:**

```
index="windows_logs" sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" (OriginalFileName IN ("*apollo*", "*athena*", "*freyja*", "*merlin*", "*thanatos*", "*atlas*", "*arachne*", "*hannibal*", "*xenon*", "*service_wrapper*")) | table _time, User, EventCode, OriginalFileName, Image, ParentCommandLine, CommandLine, ProcessId
```
