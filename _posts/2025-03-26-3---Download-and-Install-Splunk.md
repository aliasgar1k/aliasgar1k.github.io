Obtain and Install the Splunk Platform on Your Selected Servers
  
The process of downloading and installing the Splunk platform is a critical step in setting up your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. Splunk is a powerful tool that processes and analyzes machine-generated data, enabling organizations to gain valuable insights into their security posture and overall IT environment.  

## Preparing for Installation

Before proceeding with the download and installation of Splunk, it is essential to prepare adequately:  

- **System Requirements**: Review the system requirements for the version of Splunk you plan to install. Ensure that the server you intend to use (in this case, the SOC analyst Windows machine) meets or exceeds these requirements in terms of CPU, memory, disk space, and operating system compatibility.  
- **User Permissions**: Ensure that you have administrative privileges on the machine. This is crucial for installation and configuration, as certain system-level changes will be needed.  
- **Access to Network**: Make sure that the server is connected to the network and has internet access for downloading the installation files and any necessary updates.

## Before you install

**Disable or Limit Antivirus Software**: Antivirus software can slow down Splunk Enterprise due to its high disk throughput requirements. It is essential to configure the antivirus to avoid scanning Splunk installation directories and processes before starting the installation.  
  
**Directory Naming for Installation**:  The default installation path for Splunk is C:\Program Files\Splunk, which may lead to problems in distributed deployments or advanced features. Windows has a MAX_PATH limit of 260 characters, restricting access to files with longer paths. To mitigate these issues, consider installing Splunk in a directory with a shorter path, such as C:\Splunk or D:\SPL.

**Installation Options:** The Windows installer gives you two choices: Install with the default installation settings, or configure all settings prior to installing. Customize Options will allow you to:
- Configure installation Location
- Configure default management and Web network ports.
- Configures to run as the Local System or Domain user.
