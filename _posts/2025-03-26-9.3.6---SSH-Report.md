When it comes to reporting, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Most professionals rely on templates provided by their organization or create their own based on experience. This report is a critical artifact, designed to be presented across all levels of the company—from technical teams to executives—to provide actionable insights into C2 activity.  
  
Below, I’ve created a template that simplifies the reporting process. This real-world format includes an **executive summary**, **detailed analysis**, and **actionable recommendations**. It’s designed to be high-level yet technical, ensuring it meets the needs of diverse stakeholders.  
  
**Disclaimer:** Please note that certain sections of this report contain sample data and hypothetical scenarios, which may not be directly related to our current situation. These examples are intended to illustrate the format and structure of a real-world report, but may include fictional or irrelevant information that is not applicable to our specific use case.

## Report  

**Date:** 2023-02-20  
  
**Report ID:** SSH-2023-02  
  
**Generated by:** [Your Name]  
  
**Executive Summary:**  
This report provides an overview of SSH brute force activity on our network for the past 30 days. We analyzed 5,000 SSH login attempts and found that 20% of them were brute force attempts. The top 3 sources of brute force attempts were IP addresses from China, Russia, and Brazil. We recommend implementing additional security measures to prevent brute force attacks and monitoring SSH login activity more closely to detect potential security threats.  
  
**Summary of Findings:**  
* Total SSH login attempts: 5,000  
* Brute force attempts: 1,000 (20%)  
* Successful logins: 4,000 (80%)  
* Top 3 sources of brute force attempts:  
	+ China: 40%    
	+ Russia: 25%  
	+ Brazil: 15%  
* Average time to detect a brute force attempt: 1 hour  
* Most targeted usernames:  
	+ root: 50%    
	+ admin: 20%  
	+ test: 10%

**Recommendations:**  
Based on the data, we recommend:  
1. Implementing a rate limiting policy to prevent brute force attacks  
2. Monitoring SSH login activity more closely to detect potential security threats  
3. Using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication  
4. Regularly reviewing and updating SSH server configurations  
5. Conducting regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities  
  
**Conclusion:**  
This report provides a comprehensive overview of SSH brute force activity on our network. By implementing the recommended security measures, we can improve the overall security posture of our organization and prevent potential security threats.
