After successfully configuring **Splunk** as our core SIEM solution, it‚Äôs time to take our security monitoring to the next level. By simulating a more production-like environment, we‚Äôll integrate essential components found in real-world security architectures: a **firewall/router**, an **intrusion detection system (IDS)**, and an **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** solution. These critical tools will greatly enhance our visibility across both network traffic and endpoints, providing a more comprehensive dataset for analysis and threat detection within **Splunk**.

## Why Upgrade?

A standalone SIEM, although powerful, depends heavily on the quality and breadth of the data it ingests. To truly enhance our threat detection capabilities, we need tools that monitor network traffic at the perimeter, inspect data in transit, and track suspicious activities on endpoints. By incorporating these elements, we turn **Splunk** into a central hub for holistic, real-time threat visibility. This upgrade not only simulates a more realistic enterprise security environment but also enables deeper analysis and correlation of security events across multiple layers of the network.

## Components to Be Integrated

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the critical components we‚Äôre integrating and how they‚Äôll contribute to a more robust, layered security architecture:

### üîê **Firewall/Router: pfSense**

We'll begin by using **pfSense** as our perimeter defense tool, acting as both a **firewall** and **router** to segment and protect the internal network.

- **Installation**: Install pfSense on a dedicated system or virtual machine.
- **Initial Configuration**: Set up pfSense using the console, and perform additional configuration through the Web UI.
- **Firewall Rules**: Define and apply firewall rules to regulate traffic between the internal network (**LAN**) and the external network (**WAN**).
- **Log Forwarding**: Configure pfSense to forward its firewall logs to **Splunk**, enabling centralized monitoring of traffic patterns, blocked connections, and other important network-level activity.

This setup will provide us with perimeter visibility, helping us track and analyze inbound and outbound traffic in real-time.

### üõ°Ô∏è **IDS/IPS: Suricata**

Next, we‚Äôll deploy **Suricata** as an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**, sitting between the internal and external network segments.

- **Installation**: Suricata will be deployed on a bridge interface, allowing it to passively monitor traffic between the LAN and WAN.
- **IDS Configuration**: We‚Äôll set Suricata to **IDS-only mode**, which will detect threats without actively blocking them (though it could be set to IPS mode if we choose to block malicious traffic in the future).
- **Log Integration**: Suricata‚Äôs logs and alerts will be forwarded to **Splunk**, enabling us to correlate network-based anomalies with other events in the environment.

Suricata will provide essential insights into network traffic, helping us identify potential threats based on signature-based detection and behavior analysis.

### üñ•Ô∏è **EDR: OSSEC**

Finally, we‚Äôll integrate **OSSEC** to monitor activity on endpoints and complete the visibility gap between the network and individual systems.

- **Installation**: Set up an **OSSEC** server and deploy agents across the target endpoints (servers, workstations, etc.).
- **Agent Configuration**: Connect these agents to the central OSSEC server for unified management and monitoring.
- **Splunk Integration**: Configure **OSSEC** to forward event logs to **Splunk**, providing endpoint-level visibility into potential security events.

OSSEC will offer critical data such as **file integrity checks**, **rootkit detection**, and **unauthorized login attempts**, adding another layer of monitoring to our environment.

## **Network Diagram: Visualizing the Upgrade**

The following diagram illustrates how our upgraded network architecture will look after integrating **pfSense**, **Suricata**, and **OSSEC**. This structure enhances both our **network visibility** and **control** by segmenting the LAN and WAN, and placing Suricata in between as an IDS/IPS solution.

In this configuration:

- **pfSense** acts as the firewall/router, controlling traffic between the **Internal Network (LAN)** and the **External Network (WAN)**.
- **Suricata** is deployed as a bridge between the two network segments, analyzing all traffic for malicious behavior in **IDS mode**.
- **OSSEC** will monitor endpoint activities, providing a deeper insight into individual system behavior.

## What‚Äôs Next?

With these integrations, we‚Äôve significantly expanded our visibility across both the network and endpoints, creating a more complete and integrated security monitoring solution. As we move forward, this setup will lay the foundation for future enhancements, such as implementing a **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** solution. This will enable us to automate responses to specific threats and streamline incident handling.

Stay tuned as we continue to build a more robust and intelligent security monitoring environment powered by **Splunk**, with even more advanced features and integrations to come.
