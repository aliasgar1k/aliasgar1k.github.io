After successfully configuring Splunk as our core SIEM solution, it's time to elevate our security monitoring capabilities by simulating a more production-like environment. In this upgrade, we‚Äôll be integrating critical components that are commonly found in real-world security architectures: a firewall/router, an intrusion detection system (IDS), and an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution. These additions will significantly increase our visibility across the network and endpoints, providing a richer dataset for analysis and threat detection within Splunk.

## Why Upgrade?

A standalone SIEM, while powerful, relies heavily on the quality and breadth of data it ingests. By introducing tools that monitor traffic at the perimeter, inspect data in transit, and watch for suspicious activity on endpoints, we enable Splunk to become a central hub for comprehensive threat visibility. This upgrade will help simulate a more realistic enterprise security landscape and allow us to perform deeper analysis and correlation of security events.

## Components to Be Integrated

Here‚Äôs an overview of the tools we‚Äôll be adding and how they‚Äôll contribute to our upgraded environment:

### üîê Firewall/Router: pfSense

We will use **pfSense** as our perimeter defense tool to emulate a typical firewall/router setup.

- **Installation**: Download and install pfSense on a dedicated system or virtual machine. 
- **Initial Configuration**: Perform basic setup via the console and further customization through the Web UI.
- **Firewall Rules**: Define and apply firewall rules to control network traffic as needed.
- **Log Forwarding**: Configure pfSense to send firewall logs to Splunk for centralized monitoring.

This setup allows us to capture traffic patterns, blocked connections, and other network-level activity, enriching our SIEM data with crucial perimeter visibility.

### üõ°Ô∏è IDS/IPS: Suricata

Next, we‚Äôll implement **Suricata** to monitor and analyze network traffic for signs of malicious behavior.

- **Installation**: Deploy Suricata on a bridge interface to passively listen to traffic.
- **IDS Configuration**: Set Suricata in IDS-only mode to detect threats without blocking traffic.
- **Log Integration**: Configure Suricata to forward alerts and logs to Splunk.

This will help us detect suspicious network signatures, enabling the SIEM to correlate traffic-based anomalies with other logs in the environment.

### üñ•Ô∏è EDR: OSSEC

Finally, we‚Äôll deploy **OSSEC** to monitor endpoint activity and ensure we have insights from the systems themselves.

- **Installation**: Set up OSSEC server and agents across desired endpoints.
- **Agent Configuration**: Connect agents to the central server for unified management.
- **Splunk Integration**: Forward logs from OSSEC to Splunk for endpoint-level visibility.

OSSEC will provide valuable data such as file integrity checks, rootkit detection, and unauthorized login attempts‚Äîfilling in the endpoint visibility gap in our monitoring setup.

## What‚Äôs Next?

With these integrations, we significantly expand our visibility across the network and endpoints, creating a more holistic view of potential security events. This forms a strong foundation for further enhancements. In the near future, we‚Äôll explore implementing a **Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)** solution, enabling automated responses to specific threats and streamlining incident handling.

Stay tuned as we continue to build a robust and intelligent security monitoring environment powered by Splunk.
