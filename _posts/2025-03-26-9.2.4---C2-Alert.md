After conducting a thorough analysis, we have successfully identified a query to detect logs containing Mythic C2 agent names. The query, which searches the `windows_logs` index for events with a `sourcetype` of `WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, will return all logs where the `OriginalFileName` matches any of the known Mythic C2 agent names, including Apollo, Athena, Freyja, Merlin, Thanatos, Atlas, Arachne, Hannibal, Xenon, and Service Wrapper.

```
index="windows_logs" sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" 
| search OriginalFileName IN ("*apollo*", "*athena*", "*freyja*", "*merlin*", "*thanatos*", "*atlas*", "*arachne*", "*hannibal*", "*xenon*", "*service_wrapper*")
```

With this query in place, we will now utilize it to create a targeted alert that will notify us of any potential Mythic C2 agent activity. This alert will enable our security team to rapidly identify and respond to potential threats, ensuring the protection of our systems and data. By leveraging this query and alert, we will enhance our threat detection capabilities and stay one step ahead of potential attackers.

| table _time, User, EventCode, OriginalFileName, Image, ParentCommandLine, CommandLine, ProcessId
