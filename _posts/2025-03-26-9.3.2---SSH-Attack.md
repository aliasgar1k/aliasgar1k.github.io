## Introduction
  
Let's begin by accessing our Kali Linux attacker machine. We will utilize Hydra, one of the most popular tools for conducting brute force attacks, to simulate an SSH brute force attack. Hydra comes pre-installed with Kali Linux, so thereâ€™s no need for manual installation.  
  
In this demonstration, we will target a specific user with the username **ubuntu** (which corresponds to our target Linux machine). In real-world scenarios, an attacker would typically perform user enumeration to identify valid usernames before executing a brute force or credential stuffing attack, especially if multiple user accounts are involved.  
  
## Creating a Custom Wordlist
  
We will also create a custom wordlist based on the well-known `rockyou` wordlist, which is included with Kali Linux. But as we done this step in RDP Brute Force Attack, we already have a custom wordlist. So, now we will just append our target user password to it for the sake of this example.

```
echo "ubuntu" >> passwords.txt
```

Verify the Custom Passwords Wordlist

```
cat passwords.txt
```

You should see 21 random passwords listed, and the last entry being the actual password for the user.

## Performing the Attack
  
With the target user and custom wordlist prepared, we can move on to executing the brute force attack. The command below performs a password brute force attack on user `ubuntu`, targeting the Linux client machine.  
  
```
hydra -l "ubuntu" -P /home/kali/Desktop/passwords.txt ssh://192.168.125.40 -t 1 -V
```
  
**Command Breakdown:**    
- **`-l "j.smith"`**: Specifies the username for the brute force attempt.  
- **`-P /home/kali/Desktop/passwords.txt`**: Provides Hydra with the custom password wordlist.  
- **`ssh://192.168.125.30`**: Indicates the type of service being attacked (SSH) and the target IP address. 
- **`-t 1`**: Sets the number of concurrent tasks to run (keeping it at 1 to avoid network overload).  
- **`-V`**: Enables verbose output during the operation.  
  
After the attack has completed, you should see results indicating 20 failed attempts and 1 successful attempt on the password for the user.

And we can check this using the SSH client tool itself by connecting to the target machine. Use the following command:  
  
```
ssh j.smith@192.168.125.40
```
  
Enter the password **ubuntu** when prompted.  
Now you are connected to the target machine using SSH.
