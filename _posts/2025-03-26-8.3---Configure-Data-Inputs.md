Configuring data inputs is a crucial step in setting up the Splunk Universal Forwarder to ensure it collects the necessary logs for analysis. This process involves specifying the exact logs or data sources the forwarder should monitor and send to the Splunk indexer. You can define inputs based on file paths, network ports, or specific directories containing the logs. By carefully configuring these inputs, you ensure that relevant data is captured and forwarded efficiently, enabling comprehensive monitoring, analysis, and insights within Splunk Enterprise. Properly defining data inputs optimizes performance and ensures that only the required data is processed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption.
  
## Windows  

- To verify the log files being sent by the forwarder to the receiver, use the following command:  

```
C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\bin>.\splunk.exe list monitor
```

- If prompted, enter the Administrator user credentials that were created earlier.

- At this point, youâ€™ll only see logs related to the Splunk forwarder itself, and no system-level logs.  
- To monitor specific log files such as Sysmon Logs and Windows Event Logs as we have identified before and send them to the receiver, use the commands given below. 
- There are two methods to send logs: 
	- with indexing (sends logs to the specified index)
	- without indexing (sends logs to the "main" index).  
  
- **To send logs with proper indexing**, use the following command:  
  
```
C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\bin>.\splunk.exe add monitor -source "C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs" -index windows_logs
Added monitor of 'C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs'.
```
  
- **To send logs without indexing**, use this command:  
  
```
C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\bin>.\splunk.exe add monitor "C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs"
Added monitor of 'C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs'.
```

- Now, if you check again for monitored files, you should see the system-level log files included as well:  
  
```
C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\bin>.\splunk.exe list monitor
```

- Note that this command actually creates an `inputs.conf` file for configuration, which is saved at `C:\Program Files\splunkforwarder\etc\apps\search\local\inputs.conf`.

### Inputs file

 - we can Also do this by editing the `inputs.conf` file to specify which log files or directories the Splunk Universal Forwarder should monitor for data collection.  
	- Default Location: `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf`  
	- Custom/Apps Location: `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/local/inputs.conf`  (Recommended)

- Sample `inputs.conf` file:

```
# Monitor a specific log file
[monitor://C:\path\to\logfile.log]
disabled = false
index = windows_logs              # Change to your desired index
sourcetype = custom_log           # Change to your desired sourcetype

# Monitor the Application event log
[WinEventLog:Application]
disabled = false
index = windows_logs              # Change to your desired index

# Monitor the Security event log
[WinEventLog:Security]
disabled = false
index = windows_logs              # Change to your desired index

# Monitor the System event log
[WinEventLog:System]
disabled = false
index = windows_logs              # Change to your desired index

# Monitor all files in a specific directory
[monitor://C:\path\to\directory\*]
recursive = true
disabled = false
index = windows_logs              # Change to your desired index
sourcetype = custom_directory_log  # Change to your desired sourcetype
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Monitoring a Specific Log File**: The configuration under `[monitor://C:\path\to\logfile.log]` specifies paths to files if you want to monitor specific custom log files. Change `C:\path\to\logfile.log` to the actual file path. `index` sets the index where the data will be stored, and `sourcetype` defines how the log data should be interpreted.  
2. **Monitoring Windows Event Logs**: The lines such as `[WinEventLog:Application]`, `[WinEventLog:Security]`, and `[WinEventLog:System]` set up monitoring for three important Windows Event Logs: Application, Security, and System, respectively.
3. **Monitoring All Files in a Directory**: The configuration `[monitor://C:\path\to\directory\*]` is useful when you want to monitor all files within a specified directory. The `recursive = true` setting allows Splunk to monitor subdirectories as well.
  
**Notes:**  
- Ensure that the specified paths are accessible and that the Splunk Forwarder has the appropriate permissions to read from those files and directories.  
- Customize the `index` and `sourcetype` values according to your organization's naming conventions or specific requirements.  
- After modifying `inputs.conf`, remember to restart the Splunk Universal Forwarder for the changes to take effect.

## Linux
  
- To verify the logs that the forwarder is sending to the receiver, use the following command:  
  
```
/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk list monitor
```

- You will notice that only logs related to the Splunk forwarder itself are displayed, and no system level logs are present.  
- Next, we need to add our log file for monitoring to ensure that it is sent to the receiver.
- There are two methods for sending logs:
	- with indexing
	- without indexing (sends logs to the "main" index).
  
- **To send logs with proper indexing**, use the command below:

```
/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor -source /var/log -index linux_logs
```

- **To send logs without indexing**, use this command:  

```
/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor /var/log
```
  
- Now, if you check again for the monitored files, you should see the system-level log files included as well.

### Inputs file

 - we can Also do this by editing the `inputs.conf` file to specify which log files or directories the Splunk Universal Forwarder should monitor for data collection.  
	- Default Location: `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf`  
	- Custom/Apps Location: `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/local/inputs.conf`  (Recommended)

- Sample `inputs.conf` file:

```
# Monitor a specific log file
[monitor://C:\path\to\logfile.log]                # Monitors a specific log file.
disabled = false                                    # Enables the monitoring of this log file.
index = your_index_name                             # Specify the index where logs will be stored.
sourcetype = your_sourcetype_name                   # Specify the sourcetype for the log data.

# Monitor all logs in a specific directory
[monitor://C:\var\log\]                            # Monitors all files in the specified directory.
disabled = false                                    # Enables the monitoring of this directory.
index = your_index_name                             # Specify the index for storing the logs.
sourcetype = syslog                                 # Define the sourcetype for all logs in this directory.

# Optional: To monitor all files in a directory recursively
[monitor://C:\path\to\directory\*]                 # Monitors all files in the specified directory and subdirectories.
recursive = true                                    # Enables recursive monitoring of subdirectories.
disabled = false                                    # Enables the monitoring of this directory.
index = your_index_name                             # Specify the index for storing the logs.
sourcetype = your_sourcetype_name                   # Specify the sourcetype for the logs collected from this directory.
```

**Explanation:**  

1. **Monitoring a Specific Log File**: This section is used to monitor a specific log file located at the designated path.  
2. **Monitoring All Logs in a Directory**: This configuration monitors all files within a specified directory, useful when you want to capture logs in bulk from that location.   
3. **Monitoring All Files Recursively**: This optional section allows you to monitor all files in a directory and include all subdirectories, ensuring comprehensive log collection.  
  
**Notes:**  
- **`C:\path\to\logfile.log`**: Replace with the actual path to the log file you wish to monitor.  
- **`C:\var\log\`**: Change to the directory containing the logs you want to capture.  
- **`your_index_name`**: Specify the appropriate index name where you want the logs to be stored.  
- **`your_sourcetype_name`**: Define the sourcetype that accurately describes the format of the logs you are monitoring.
