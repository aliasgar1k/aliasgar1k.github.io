## Introduction
  
Secure Shell (SSH) brute force attacks are a type of cyber attack where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to a computer or network by trying multiple username and password combinations. From here we will walk through the process of enabling SSH, simulating an SSH brute force attack, analyzing logs, creating alerts, building a dashboard, and generating a report.  
  
## Step 1: Enabling SSH
  
We will begin by enabling Secure Shell protocol on a Linux client machine, which will allow us to establish a secure remote connection to the system. This step is crucial in setting up the environment for the simulated attack, as it provides the attacker with a potential entry point. By enabling SSH, we are essentially creating a doorway for the attacker to attempt to gain access to the system. Enabling SSH will also allow us to configure the protocol to use secure authentication methods, such as public key authentication, to prevent unauthorized access.  
  
## Step 2: Attack
  
Next, we will simulate an SSH brute force attack, which involves mimicking the actions of a malicious actor attempting to gain unauthorized access to the system. This step will help us understand the tactics and techniques used by attackers to try and breach the system, and will provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of the SSH protocol. By simulating the attack, we can gain a better understanding of the potential risks and threats associated with SSH brute force attacks, such as the ability of an attacker to guess or crack passwords, or to exploit vulnerabilities in the SSH protocol.  
  
## Step 3: Analysis
  
After simulating the attack, we will analyze the logs to identify patterns and anomalies in SSH activity. This step is critical in understanding the nature of the attack and identifying potential vulnerabilities in the system. By analyzing the logs, we can gain insights into the attack methodology, including the number of attempts made, the source IP addresses, and the usernames targeted. This information will help us to better understand the attack landscape and identify areas for improvement, such as configuring the SSH server to use secure authentication methods or implementing rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.  
  
## Step 4: Alert
  
We will then create alerts for suspicious SSH activity, which will ensure that security teams are notified of potential threats in real-time. This step is essential in detecting and responding to SSH brute force attacks, as it enables swift action to be taken to prevent or mitigate the attack. By creating alerts, we can ensure that security teams are proactive in their response to potential threats, rather than reactive. Alerts can be configured to trigger on a variety of conditions, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address, or login attempts from unknown or untrusted IP addresses.  
  
## Step 5: Dashboard
  
Next, we will build a dashboard to visualize SSH login attempts and attack patterns. This step will provide a clear and concise overview of the attack landscape, allowing us to quickly identify trends and patterns in SSH activity. The dashboard will provide a centralized location for monitoring and analyzing SSH activity, enabling security teams to make informed decisions about the security of the system. The dashboard can be configured to display a variety of metrics, such as the number of login attempts, the number of failed login attempts, and the source IP addresses of the login attempts.  
  
## Step 6: Report
  
Finally, we will generate a report summarizing SSH attack trends and critical events. This step will provide a comprehensive overview of the attack landscape, including the number of attempts made, the source IP addresses, and the usernames targeted. The report will help us to understand the overall impact of the attack and identify areas for improvement, enabling us to refine our security controls and prevent future attacks. By generating a report, we can gain a deeper understanding of the attack landscape and make informed decisions about the security of the system, such as implementing additional security measures or modifying the SSH configuration to prevent brute force attacks.
