**Step 1: Locate the SSH Log File**  
  
The default location of the SSH log file varies depending on the Linux distribution. Common locations include files that store authentication-related logs, security-related logs, and system logs. Knowing these locations is crucial for monitoring and analyzing SSH-related activities, identifying potential security issues, and troubleshooting connection problems.  
  
* Ubuntu/Debian: `/var/log/auth.log`    
* Red Hat/CentOS: `/var/log/secure`    
* OpenSUSE: `/var/log/messages`
  
**Step 2: Understanding the Log File Contents**  
  
These log file contains records of SSH-related events, including login attempts. A typical entry in the log file may look like this:  

```
Apr 18 14:30:01 client-2 sshd[3432]: Failed password for ubuntu from 192.168.125.50 port 58130 ssh2
Apr 18 14:30:01 client-2 sshd[1234]: Failed password for invalid user test from 192.168.1.100 port 4567 ssh2
Apr 18 14:30:01 client-2 sshd[1234]: pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=192.168.1.100 
Apr 18 14:30:02 client-2 sshd[1234]: PAM 1 more authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=192.168.1.100 
Apr 18 14:30:03 client-2 sshd[1235]: Accepted password for ubuntu from 192.168.1.100 port 4568 ssh2
```

Here's what each log line means:  

| **Message**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                    |     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| `Failure password for ubuntu`                 | Indicates that a user attempted to log in with an invalid password.                                                                                                                |     |
| `Failed password for invalid user`            | Indicates that a user attempted to log in with an invalid username or password.                                                                                                    |     |
| `pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure` | Indicates that the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) system reported an authentication failure. This line provides more detailed information about the authentication process. |     |
| `PAM 1 more authentication failure`           | Indicates that the PAM system has tracked multiple authentication failures from the same IP address. This line can indicate a potential brute-force attack.                        |     |
| `Accepted password for ubuntu`                | Indicates that a user successfully logged in with a valid username and password.                                                                                                   |     |
  
These log lines provide valuable information about the authentication process and can help identify potential security issues, such as brute-force attacks or invalid login attempts. 

For our purposes, the first two log lines are the most essential, specifically **Failed password for ubuntu**, which helps us track attempts with the right username but wrong password, and **Failed password for invalid user**, which helps us track attempts with the wrong username and wrong password, as these log lines provide valuable information about the authentication process and can help identify potential security issues, such as brute-force attacks or invalid login attempts.

**Step 3: Creating a Splunk Query**
  
To detect SSH brute force attacks using Splunk, create a query that looks for the following:  
  
* `source=/var/log/auth.log` (or the relevant log file location)  
* `Failed password` or `invalid user` in the log message  
* Multiple events from the same IP address 
  
Example Splunk query:  

```
index="linux_logs" source="/var/log/auth.log" ("Failed password for" OR "Failed password for invalid user") 
| rex field=_raw "from\s(?P<SourceIp>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
| stats count as "Fails" by SourceIp
| where Fails > 5
```

This query looks for failed login attempts in the `/var/log/auth.log` file, counts the number of attempts from each IP address. If an IP address has more than 5 attempts, it is considered a potential brute force attack.

**Conclusion:**  
By following these steps, you can detect SSH brute force attacks using Splunk. Remember to adjust the query to fit your specific use case and log file locations. Regularly monitoring your SSH logs can help you identify and respond to potential security threats.
