When it comes to reporting, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Most professionals rely on templates provided by their organization or create their own based on experience. This report is a critical artifact, designed to be presented across all levels of the company—from technical teams to executives—to provide actionable insights into C2 activity.  
  
Below, I’ve created a template that simplifies the reporting process. This real-world format includes an **executive summary**, **detailed analysis**, and **actionable recommendations**. It’s designed to be high-level yet technical, ensuring it meets the needs of diverse stakeholders.

**Disclaimer:** Please note that certain sections of this report contain sample data and hypothetical scenarios, which may not be directly related to our current situation. These examples are intended to illustrate the format and structure of a real-world report, but may include fictional or irrelevant information that is not applicable to our specific use case.

## Report

**Date:** 2023-02-20  
  
**Report ID:** C2-2023-02  
  
**Generated by:** [Your Name]  
  
**Executive Summary:**  
This report provides an overview of C2 activity detected on our network for the past 30 days. We analyzed over 10,000 network sessions and identified 50 potential C2 communications. The top 3 C2 protocols detected were HTTP, DNS, and TCP. We recommend further investigation into these activities to determine the intent and scope of the potential threat.  
  
**Summary of Findings:**  
* Total network sessions analyzed: 10,000  
* Potential C2 communications detected: 50  
* Top 3 C2 protocols:  
	+ HTTP: 60%  
	+ DNS: 20%  
	+ FTP: 10%  
* Top 3 source IP addresses:  
	+ 192.168.125.60: 20%  
	+ 192.168.125.200: 15%  
	+ 192.168.125.50: 10%  
* Average duration of C2 communications: 10 seconds

**Recommendations:**  
Based on the data, we recommend:   
1. Further investigation into the potential C2 communications to determine the intent and scope of the threat    
2. Implementation of additional security measures to prevent C2 communications, such as blocking suspicious IP addresses and protocols  
3. Monitoring of network activity for signs of C2 communications, such as unusual patterns of communication or data transfer  
4. Conducting regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers  
  
**Conclusion:**  
This report provides a comprehensive overview of C2 activity detected on our network. By further investigating these activities and implementing additional security measures, we can improve the overall security posture of our organization and prevent potential security threats.
