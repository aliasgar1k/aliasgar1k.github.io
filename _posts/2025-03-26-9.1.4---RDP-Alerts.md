## Introduction

Alerts are vital for monitoring specific events and responding effectively within your environment. They use saved searches to continuously scan for relevant events, either in real time or according to a scheduled timeframe. When the results of these searches meet predetermined conditions, the alert is triggered, allowing for immediate awareness of critical incidents.  
  
The real power of alerts lies in their ability to automate responses through various alert actions. Once triggered, alerts can initiate tasks such as sending notifications, executing scripts, or logging incidents, ensuring you have the tools you need to react promptly and effectively. This not only enhances your organization's ability to detect anomalies or threats but also streamlines your incident response processes. By leveraging alerts, you can stay informed and take proactive measures to mitigate potential issues before they escalate.

## The Alerting Workflow

Alerts combine a saved search, configurations for type and trigger conditions, and alert actions. Here are some details about how the different parts of an alert work together.
  
**Search: What do you want to track?**  
Start with a search for the events you want to track. Save the search as an alert.  

**Alert type: How often do you want to check for events?**  
The alert uses the saved search to check for events. Adjust the alert type to configure how often the search runs. Use a scheduled alert to check for events on a regular basis. You can also use a real-time alert to monitor for events continuously.  

**Alert trigger conditions and throttling: How often do you want to trigger an alert?**  
An alert does not have to trigger every time it generates search results. Set trigger conditions to manage when the alert triggers. You can also throttle an alert to control how soon the next alert can trigger after an initial alert.

**Alert Action: What happens when the alert triggers?**  
When an alert triggers, it can initialize one or more alert actions. An alert action can notify you of a triggered alert and help you start responding to it. You can configure alert action frequency and type.

## Alert types

There are two alert types, scheduled and real-time. Alert type definitions are based on alert search timing. Depending on the scenario, you can configure timing, triggering, and other behavior for either alert type.

Here is a comparison of scheduled and real-time alerts.

| Alert type    | When it searches for events                                                                                                 | Triggering options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Throttling options                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scheduled** | Searches according to a schedule. Choose from the available timing options or use a cron expression to schedule the search. | Specify conditions for triggering the alert based on result or result field counts. When a set of search results meets the trigger conditions, the alert can trigger one time or once for each of the results.                                         | Specify a time period for suppression.                           |
| **Real-time** | Searches continuously.                                                                                                      | **Per-result**: Triggers every time there is a search result.                                                                                                                                                                                          | Specify a time period and optional field values for suppression. |
| **Real-time** | Searches continuously.                                                                                                      | **Rolling time window**: Specify conditions for triggering the alert based on result or result field counts within a rolling time window. For example, a real-time alert can trigger whenever there are more than ten results in a five minute window. | Specify a time period for suppression.                           |

## Alert example summary

**Use case** - Use the **Triggered Alerts** list to record WARNING error instances.
**Alert type** - Real-time
**Search** - Look for all errors in real-time.
**Triggering condition** - Check the alert search results for errors of type WARNING. Trigger the alert action if results include any WARNING errors.
**Alert action** - List the alert in the Triggered Alerts page.

## Set up the Alert

### Step 1 

From the **Search and Reporting** home page, create the following search.

```
index=windows_logs (EventCode=4625 AND Logon_Type=3) | stats count as attempts by Source_Network_Address, Workstation_Name, Account_Name | where attempts > 5 
```

### Step 2

Select **Save As > Alert**.

### Step 3

Specify the following alert field values.
	- **Title**: RDP Brute Force
	- **Alert type**: Scheduled to run every 5 min using cronjob (`*/5 * * * *`)
	- **Trigger condition**: Number of results > 0

### Step 4

Select the **List in Triggered Alerts** alert action.

### Step 5

Click **Save**.

You can view all the created alerts in the **"Alerts"** tab under **Search & Reporting**.  

![](2025-03-26-9.1.4---RDP-Alerts-5.png)

To view the results of these alerts, visit the **"Triggered Alerts"** page by selecting it from the dropdown menu under **"Activity"** in the top-right navigation menu.

### Bonus Step

you can also configure an alert to run a shell script or batch file when the alert triggers. 
The script or batch file that an alert triggers must be at either of the following locations:

```
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/scripts
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<AppName>/bin/scripts
```

As a best practice, use Python to write the custom alert action script. However, the Splunk platform supports the following script formats for Windows and *nix platforms:

| Windows platforms | *Nix platforms                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| _filename_.py     | _filename_.py                                     |
| _filename_.bat    | _filename_.sh                                     |
| _filename_.js     | _filename_.js                                     |
| _filename_.cmd    | _filename_ (executable file without an extension) |
| _filename_.exe    |                                                   |

For instance, you can create a simple batch script to notify a message alert. Create a file named `rdp_alert_script.bat` and write the following script within it:  

```
@echo off
set "message=Alert! RDP Brute Force Attempt Detected!"
powershell -Command "Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; $speak = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer; $speak.Speak('%message%')"
exit
```

save the script and move it to the following location: 

```
C:\Program Files\Splunk\bin\scripts\bin\scripts\rdp_alert_script.bat
```

![](2025-03-26-9.1.4---RDP-Alerts-8.png)

Now, edit the alert from the **"Alerts"** tab.  

![](2025-03-26-9.1.4---RDP-Alerts-9.png)

Click on **"Add Actions"** and select **"Run a script"** to execute the script when the action is triggered. Enter the filename as `rdp_alert_script.bat` and click **"Save."**  


![](2025-03-26-9.1.4---RDP-Alerts-10.png)

Now every time a RDP brute force attempt is detected the alert will trigger to run this script and it will give us voice notification.
