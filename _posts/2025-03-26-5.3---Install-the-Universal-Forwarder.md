- Next provide the **IP Address** and **Port** for Deployment Server. Note we you don't have a **Deployment Server** in your infrastructure, so we can skip these this by click "**Next**".

## Linux Installation:

**Installation Packages**  
- **Tar File**: Contains only the necessary files. Can be installed anywhere you have permission.  
- **Installation Packages (.rpm, .deb, .pkg, etc.)**: Includes checks for software dependencies and installs in a specific location based on the OS.  
  
**Default Installation Location**  
- The Universal Forwarder installs by default in `/opt/splunkforwarder`. 
- Splunk Enterprise installs in `/opt/splunk`.  
  
**Notes on Tar File Installation**  
- Some tar versions may not support the `-C` argument. If so, either change to your desired directory before running the tar command or place the tar file in that directory.  
- The Universal Forwarder does not create a **splunk user**. You must create this user manually if required.  
- Ensure sufficient disk space for the data you plan to index.  
- Do not install over an existing Splunk Enterprise installation.  

**About the Least-Privileged User**:  
Running the universal forwarder as a root user is not a security best practice. However, a user running the forwarder as a basic non-root user cannot fully manage the forwarder or add-ons. To resolve this issue, the universal forwarder installer creates "least privileged" users with capabilities specific to running the universal forwarder.

If Splunk is unable to install a least privileged user, it will install as a non-root user. To learn more about how to add, enable, disable, and troubleshoot least privileged users, see [Secure your *nix universal forwarder with a least privileged user](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/9.0.2/Forwarder/Installleastprivileged).

For the universal forwarder to create a least privileged user at installation, your system must meet the following criteria:
- One or more Universal Forwarders; least privileged mode does not run on other systems or applications.
- `systemd` version 219 or greater.
- Linux x86_64, ARM, ARM64

### Installation

- Login as ROOT to the machine that you want to install the Splunk Universal Forwarder.
- Create the Splunk user and group. (not necessary, we can also use the default user)

```
useradd -m splunk
groupadd splunk
```

For a tar package

```
tar xvzf splunkforwarder_package_name.tgz
```

For an rpm package: 

```
# If necessary, change permissions on the file
chmod 644 splunkforwarder_package_name.rpm

# Install the Splunk Enterprise RPM in the default directory `/opt/splunk`
rpm -i splunkforwarder_package_name.rpm
```

For a .deb package:

```
dpkg -i splunkforwarder_package_name.deb
```

- Run the `chown` command to change the ownership of the splunkforwarder directory and everything under it to the user that you want to run the software. (if you have not created splunk user change to default user)

```
# for splunk user
chown -R splunk:splunk $SPLUNK_HOME

# for default user
chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu $SPLUNK_HOME
```
