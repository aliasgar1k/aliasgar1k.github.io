## About Forwarding and Receiving

In Splunk Enterprise, data can be forwarded from one instance to another or to a non-Splunk system. The instance that sends data is called a **forwarder**. There are various types of forwarders. Conversely, a **receiver** is a Splunk instance that accepts data from one or more forwarders, generally functioning as a Splunk indexer, though it can also be another forwarder.  
  
## Sample Forwarding Layout

A sample architecture consists of multiple forwarders sending data to a single receiver (an indexer), which indexes the incoming data for search availability. Forwarders provide a more robust solution for data forwarding compared to raw network feeds, offering capabilities such as metadata tagging, configurable buffering, data compression, SSL security, and the flexibility to use various network ports.

## Types of Forwarders

There are three types of forwarders in Splunk:  
  
1. **Universal Forwarder**:  
	- Contains only the essential components for data forwarding.  
	- Cannot index, search, or produce alerts.  
	- Limited parsing capabilities; primarily forwards data to a Splunk deployment.  
  
2. **Heavy Forwarder**:  
	- A full Splunk Enterprise instance that can index, search, alter data, and forward it.  
	- Retains most functionalities of Splunk but cannot perform distributed searches.  
	- Parses data before forwarding and can route data based on specific criteria.  
  
3. **Light Forwarder**:  
	- Also a full Splunk Enterprise instance but with more features disabled to reduce resource usage.  
	- Deprecated as of version 6.0; the universal forwarder is now preferred for most use cases.

## Types of Forwarder Data  

Forwarders can transmit three types of data:  
- **Raw**: Unaltered data sent over TCP.  
- **Unparsed**: Minimal processing; metadata tagging occurs with basic timestamping.  
- **Parsed**: Individual events are tagged and forwarded; allows for conditional routing based on event data.  
  
Forwarders can be configured to send raw data by adjusting settings in the outputs.conf file. By default, universal forwarders send unparsed data, while heavy forwarders send parsed data.  

For our environment we will be utilizing Universal Forwarder as it caters all of our needs and we not need anything more than that due to resource scarcity.
