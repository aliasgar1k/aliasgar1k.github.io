After conducting a thorough analysis, we have successfully identified a query to detect logs containing SSH brute force attempts. The query, which searches the `linux_logs` index for events with a `sourcetype` of `/var/log/auth.log`, will return all logs where the `failure password` or `invalid user` keywords are present in the log.  
  
```
index="linux_logs" source="/var/log/auth.log" ("Failed password for" OR "Failed password for invalid user") 
| rex field=_raw "from\s(?P<SourceIp>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
| stats count as "Fails" by SourceIp
| where Fails > 5
```

With this query in place, we will now utilize it to create a targeted alert that will notify us of any potential SSH brute force attempts. This alert will enable our security team to rapidly identify and respond to potential threats, ensuring the protection of our systems and data. By leveraging this query and alert, we will enhance our threat detection capabilities and stay one step ahead of potential attackers.

## Set up the Alert

- From the **Search and Reporting** home page, create the following search.

```
index="linux_logs" source="/var/log/auth.log" ("Failed password for" OR "Failed password for invalid user")

| stats count as "Fails" by SourceIp
| where Fails > 5
```
