When it comes to reporting, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Most professionals rely on templates provided by their organization or create their own based on experience. This report is a critical artifact, designed to be presented across all levels of the company—from technical teams to executives—to provide actionable insights into RDP brute force activity.
  
Below, I’ve created a template that simplifies the reporting process. This real-world format includes an **executive summary**, **detailed analysis**, and **actionable recommendations**. It’s designed to be high-level yet technical, ensuring it meets the needs of diverse stakeholders.

**Disclaimer:** Please note that certain sections of this report contain sample data and hypothetical scenarios, which may not be directly related to our current situation. These examples are intended to illustrate the format and structure of a real-world report, but may include fictional or irrelevant information that is not applicable to our specific use case.

## Report

**RDP Login Activity Report**  
  
**Date:** 2023-02-20  
  
**Report ID:** RDP-2023-02  
  
**Generated by:** [Your Name]  
  
**Executive Summary:**  
This report provides an overview of RDP login activity on our network for the past 30 days. We analyzed 10,000 login attempts and found that 10% of them were failed logins. The top 3 sources of failed logins were IP addresses from China, Russia, and India. We recommend implementing additional security measures to prevent brute-force attacks and monitoring login activity more closely to detect potential security threats.  
  
**Summary of Findings:**  
  
* Total login attempts: 859  
* Failed logins: 844 (98.245%)  
* Successful logins: 15 (1.746%)  
  
**Detailed Analysis:**  
The following charts and graphs provide a more detailed analysis of RDP login activity:

**Recommendations:**  
Based on the data, we recommend:  
  
1. Implementing a rate limiting policy to prevent brute-force attacks  
2. Monitoring login activity more closely to detect potential security threats  
3. Providing training to users on how to use RDP securely  
4. Conducting regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities  
  
**Conclusion:**  
This report provides a comprehensive overview of RDP login activity on our network. By implementing the recommended security measures, we can improve the overall security posture of our organization and prevent potential security threats.
