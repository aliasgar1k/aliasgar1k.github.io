Choosing the Right Model (On-Prem, Cloud, Hybrid)
  
Planning how to set up your SIEM solution, like Splunk, is a key step in making sure it works well for your organization. You need to decide between three main options: on-premises, cloud, or hybrid. Each option has its own advantages depending on what your organization needs.  
  
## Types of Deployment Models

- **On-Premises Deployment**: The SIEM system is installed on your organization’s servers, offering complete control over data and security, ideal for sensitive information.  
- **Cloud-Based Deployment**: The solution operates in the cloud, saving on hardware costs and allowing for flexibility and scalability, but may raise data security concerns.  
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Combines both on-premises and cloud approaches, allowing sensitive data to remain on-site while leveraging cloud resources for added flexibility.  
  
## What to Consider When Choosing a Deployment
  
- **Organizational Needs**: Talk to people in your organization, like SOC analysts and compliance teams, to understand their monitoring needs.  
- **Data Sensitivity**: Look at the kinds of data you have and how sensitive they are. If you have strict regulations, you might want to keep everything on-site.  
- **Current Infrastructure**: Check what IT resources you already have. If you have strong servers, an on-premises solution might make sense; if not, a cloud approach may be better.  
- **Costs**: Think about the initial costs and ongoing expenses for each option, like hardware, software, and maintenance. Cloud solutions often have predictable pricing.  
- **Scalability**: Consider how much data you have now and how much you might have in the future. Cloud models are usually easier to adjust as your needs grow.  
  
## Implementation Steps

- **Choose the best deployment model for your organization.**  
- **Identify the hardware and software needs** for on-premises or look at cloud service options.  
- **Make sure all machines can communicate** with each other without issues.  
- **Plan for future growth** to easily add more data sources down the line.  
- **Set up security measures** to protect your data while it’s being stored and transferred. 
- **Keep a documented plan** with clear outlines and diagrams for the architecture.  

## Conclusion

Carefully planning your deployment architecture is important for a successful SIEM installation. By evaluating your organization’s needs and picking the right model, you can improve how you monitor security, comply with regulations, and respond to incidents, laying a solid foundation for managing security events effectively.

Here’s a table summarizing what we've done for the "Planning The Deployment Architecture" step in the context of our Splunk SIEM implementation project:
  
| **Implementation Step** | **Description** |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Choose the best deployment model** | Select an on-premises deployment model for the Splunk instance on the SOC analyst Windows machine. |
| **Identify hardware and software needs** | Determine requirements for the Windows SOC machine, along with the two client machines (Windows and Linux). |
| **Make sure all machines can communicate** | Ensure that the SOC machine, Windows and Linux client machines, Kali Linux attacker, and Mythic C2 server can communicate effectively. |
| **Plan for future growth** | Design the architecture to allow for easy addition of more client machines or data sources if needed. |
| **Set up security measures** | Implement security measures to protect log data during storage and transmission involving the SOC, clients, and attack simulations. |
| **Keep a documented plan** | Maintain a detailed architecture plan that includes diagrams and outlines, specifying machine roles and interactions in your deployment. |
