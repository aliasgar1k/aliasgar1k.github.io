## Installing OpenSSH Server

### Step 1: Open Terminal and Update Repository
  
After opening the terminal, update your repository by entering the following command:  
  
```
sudo apt update
```

**Note:** While updating the repository, it will prompt you for your password. Enter the password to complete the process.  
  
### Step 2: Install OpenSSH Server
  
To install the OpenSSH server, run the following command:  
  
```
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

Once the installation process is complete, the SSH service will start automatically.  
  
### Step 3: Enable SSH Service
  
Although the SSH service starts automatically after installation, you can manually start it if itâ€™s not running using the following command:  
  
```
sudo service ssh start
```

To ensure the service starts on boot, enable it with the following command:  

```
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

### Step 4: Check SSH Status
  
After enabling the SSH server, check its status to ensure the SSH service is running:  
  
```
sudo service ssh status
```

Now, SSH is enabled on your Ubuntu system.  
  
**Note:** Press `Q` to return to the command line prompt.  
  
## Setup SSH Configuration File

### Step 1: Open SSH Config File
  
Open the SSH configuration file using a text editor:  
  
```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### Step 2: Uncomment PermitRootLogin
  
Locate the line `#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password` and uncomment it by removing the `#` at the beginning.

After making adjustments, save and exit. Then, restart the SSH service to apply the changes:  
  
```
sudo service ssh restart
```

## Configuring Firewall
  
### Step 1: Allow SSH in UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
  
If you have a firewall enabled, you can allow SSH traffic using the following command:  
  
```
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

### Step 2: Enable UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
  
Enable UFW to start at boot with the following command:  
  
```
sudo ufw enable
```

### Step 3: Check UFW Status
  
Verify the status of UFW to confirm that SSH is allowed:  
  
```
sudo ufw status
```

Now, you can see that SSH is enabled, and UFW is configured to allow SSH traffic.  

## Access SSH
  
To check access to SSH and verify that it is enabled, you can use the following command. Replace `username` and `your_ubuntu_ip` with your actual username and the IP address of your Ubuntu machine:  
  
```
ssh username@your_ubuntu_ip
```

This final step confirms that you can access your Ubuntu machine via SSH.
