- Go to your Splunk main server and check that data is being received from the Universal Forwarders.

## Unspecified Indexed logs
  
- If you have not indexed the logs at the step of "Configure Data Inputs" it will all end up in "main" index and can directly be view using 2 ways:

1. check the "**Data Summary**" in "**Search & Reporting**" on our Splunk Enterprise instance and we should see our hostname under "**Host**".

2.  Directly searching in for main index:

```
index="main"
```

## Logs with Specific Indexes

- Use the Search feature to verify that logs from the forwarders appear under the appropriate index.  

### Windows

- For windows we used `windows_logs`, so we will directly query in search bar:

```
index="windows_logs"
```

**Note:** if you have see no logs under `windows_logs` by this time, meaning your `splunkforwarder` service need to set log on as "local system" instead of `NT SERVICE\SplunkForwarder`.

### Linux

- For windows we used `linux_logs`, so we will directly query in search bar:

```
index="linux_logs"
```

## Debug

if you encounter an problem start from checking the status of the forwarder using `splunk status` and review `splunkd.log` for any errors related to data forwarding to solve the problem.

```
# Checking the Status of the Forwarder
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk status

# Check the splunkd.log for any errors related to data forwarding
$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
```
