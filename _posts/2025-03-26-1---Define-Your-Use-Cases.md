Identify Security Monitoring Needs and Goals

Defining use cases is an important first step when setting up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution like Splunk. This involves figuring out what specific security needs and goals your organization has.  
  
## Why Defining Use Cases is Important

- **Supports Business Goals**: Use cases should help achieve your organization's overall goals and meet compliance requirements.  
- **Focuses Resources**: They help you prioritize where to direct your security efforts and resources based on risk.  
- **Customizes Monitoring**: Tailored use cases allow you to set up your SIEM to focus on the threats that matter most to your organization.  
- **Improves Incident Response**: Clearly defined use cases help your security team respond effectively and efficiently to potential issues.  
  
## How to Define Use Cases

- **Identify Key Assets**: Figure out what important data and systems your organization needs to protect.  
- **Understand Threats**: Look at the possible threats your organization faces, both from outside and inside.  
- **Involve Stakeholders**: Talk to people from IT security, compliance, and other business areas to understand their monitoring needs.  
- **Create Scenario-Based Use Cases**: Develop specific situations that you want to detect, like multiple failed login attempts that indicate a brute-force attack.  
- **Set Success Criteria**: Define what a successful detection and response look like.  
- **Document and Review**: Keep a record of your use cases and update them regularly to reflect any changes in your environment or threats.  
  
## Conclusion

Defining use cases is an ongoing process that helps ensure your SIEM setup remains effective and aligned with your security goals. By regularly reviewing and refining your use cases, you improve your organization’s ability to detect and respond to security incidents, making your overall security stronger.

Here’s a table summarizing what we've done for the "Define Your Use Cases" step in the context of our Splunk SIEM implementation project:

| **Activity**                        | **Description**                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identify Key Assets**             | Recognized the SOC analyst Windows machine, and defined the client machines (Windows and Linux) as critical assets to monitor.              |
| **Understand Threats**              | Identified potential threats, including SSH and RDP brute-force attacks and command and control (C2) communications from the Mythic server. |
| **Involve Stakeholders**            | Engaged with team members involved in setting up and managing the Splunk instance to gather insights on security monitoring needs.          |
| **Create Scenario-Based Use Cases** | Developed specific use cases such as tracking unauthorized access attempts (SSH/RDP attacks) and monitoring C2 communications.              |
| **Set Success Criteria**            | Defined metrics for success, such as timely alerts for brute-force attempts and effective detection of suspicious C2 traffic.               |
| **Document and Review**             | Maintained documentation of use cases for ongoing reference and review to adjust as the project evolves.                                    |

This table presents a clear overview of the activities undertaken to define our use cases effectively, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent steps in our Splunk SIEM implementation project.
