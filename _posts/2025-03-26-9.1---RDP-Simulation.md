## Introduction
  
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute force attacks are a type of cyber attack where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to a computer or network by trying multiple username and password combinations. From here we will walk through the process of enabling RDP, simulating an RDP brute force attack, analyzing logs, creating alerts, building a dashboard, and generating a report.  
  
## Step 1: Enabling RDP
  
We will begin by enabling Remote Desktop Protocol on a Windows client machine, which will allow us to establish a remote connection to the system. This step is crucial in setting up the environment for the simulated attack, as it provides the attacker with a potential entry point. By enabling RDP, we are essentially creating a doorway for the attacker to attempt to gain access to the system.  
  
## Step 2: Attack 
  
Next, we will simulate an RDP brute force attack, which involves mimicking the actions of a malicious actor attempting to gain unauthorized access to the system. This step will help us understand the tactics and techniques used by attackers to try and breach the system, and will provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of the RDP protocol. By simulating the attack, we can gain a better understanding of the potential risks and threats associated with RDP brute force attacks.  
  
## Step 3: Analysis
  
After simulating the attack, we will analyze the logs to identify patterns and anomalies in RDP activity. This step is critical in understanding the nature of the attack and identifying potential vulnerabilities in the system. By analyzing the logs, we can gain insights into the attack methodology, including the number of attempts made, the source IP addresses, and the usernames targeted. This information will help us to better understand the attack landscape and identify areas for improvement.  
  
## Step 4: Alert
  
We will then create alerts for suspicious RDP activity, which will ensure that security teams are notified of potential threats in real-time. This step is essential in detecting and responding to RDP brute force attacks, as it enables swift action to be taken to prevent or mitigate the attack. By creating alerts, we can ensure that security teams are proactive in their response to potential threats, rather than reactive.  
  
## Step 5: Dashboard
  
Next, we will build a dashboard to visualize RDP login attempts and attack patterns. This step will provide a clear and concise overview of the attack landscape, allowing us to quickly identify trends and patterns in RDP activity. The dashboard will provide a centralized location for monitoring and analyzing RDP activity, enabling security teams to make informed decisions about the security of the system.  
  
## Step 6: Report 
  
Finally, we will generate a report summarizing RDP attack trends and critical events. This step will provide a comprehensive overview of the attack landscape, including the number of attempts made, the source IP addresses, and the usernames targeted. The report will help us to understand the overall impact of the attack and identify areas for improvement, enabling us to refine our security controls and prevent future attacks. By generating a report, we can gain a deeper understanding of the attack landscape and make informed decisions about the security of the system.
