**Who Am I?**

Hi, I’m Aliasgar I. Kachwala, and I’m passionate about Cybersecurity, particularly Penetration Testing and Security Analysis. I’ve been learning and growing my skills through hands-on platforms like HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and picoCTF, where I dive into CTF challenges, explore vulnerabilities, and figure out how to fix them. Every new challenge helps me sharpen my skills and discover new techniques that I apply in real-world scenarios.

This blog is a way for me to share my journey as I go. I document what I’m learning, including writeups, cheat sheets, and tools I find useful. I believe that learning by doing is key, and I hope to pass along some of that knowledge to anyone interested in diving into cybersecurity.

My Certifications:

| OSCP | Practical Ethical Hacking | Google IT Support | Tryhackme SOC L1 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
